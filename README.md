# India-Census-Data-Analysis
## Big Data Analysis Using Hadoop and visualizing results by R Programming

( I will keep updating this ) This is a Proposed model for Analysis of Big Data i.e. the census data set using HADOOP and also MAPREDUCE(framework), Hbase , Hive , Pig , Scoop and other tools for Data STORAGE and MANIPULATION. This will also include data analysis using R. Although I am still working to embed the R code in the java program to enable end users to generate beautiful visualizations by just one click.

Please see this video to understand the project and to learn how to execute the software.
